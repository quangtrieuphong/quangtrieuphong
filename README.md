### Hi there. Thank for spending your time here. 👋

I am currently a beginner in everything I aspire to be. And I'm so happy about that. It means I am, or at least my soul is, still young. :wink: :grinning:

Hope you'll find something helpful or inspiring in my repositories. I'd love any invitation to collaborate with you. :earth_asia: :hand: :earth_americas: :handshake: :earth_africa:
